The Des Moines Science Center Responsive Scheduling System

This system was built specifically for use by the Science Center of Des Moines Iowa.
It was created to deal with an over cumbersome system that was outdated. It was using Access db 
Files that were stored on file shares that suffered from synch issues and conflicts from multiple people attempting to access things at the same time.

The font end portion was also outdated, and relied on old web standards.
This project was to give those that used this system a better interface and user experience, as well
as updating the front End to use responsive/modern web practices, so that the scheduling system could be used
in conjunction with YoDeck to create dynamic layouts for the Science Centers digital signage.

Client Facing/ Internet Facing Front End

   This is the main landing page. From the internet, selecting a screen location, launches a new tab 
where the schedule for that day is show, if one is set. Otherwise the page shell just loads with No presentations scheduled for this date and screen.
